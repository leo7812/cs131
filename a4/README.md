Hello,
the problem i decided to fix was the data had info on the director but there was no column specified for director so i decided
to just remove the directors completely
To do so i will use sed to delete the two lines that say director and the name of the director as well
the output should just be all the data without the director dat

ALSO,
script already has sed command applied to movies.csv file in script so you just need to run script with movies.csv in same directory
